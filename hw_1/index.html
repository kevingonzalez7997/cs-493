        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <P>Hello im kevin and and I live in queens NY. I live with my parents and have an older sister who recently moved to florida. I am on scedule to finsish school next semester. As of right now im not too sure what my next step in life is going to be. My sister bought a house wants me to move out to florida and live with her. I love NY but at the same time I feel like this would be the only time that I would be able to. Also I am in a point in my life where I dont have many responsibility to hold me back from going. </P>
       
        <p> With all the craziness going on in my life I like to go with the flow after all, Jay-Z said it best "life is for living not living uptight"</p>
